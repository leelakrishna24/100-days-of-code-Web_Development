    <h1>What is HTML?</h1>
    <p>
      HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and is Language for creating web
      pages
    </p>
    <p>It is a markup language and not a programming language</p>
    <p>
      We "mark" certain things in the code we write which tells the web browser
      how to structure the web page
    </p>
    <p>It Does not contain any logic like conditionals or branching</p>
    <p>
      HTML consists of a series of elements and each elements tells the browser
      how to display the content
    </p>
