            For most of the series, Chandler works in statistical analysis and data reconfiguration, although he grows to loathe the job. He succeeds in transitioning to a junior copywriter position by the end of the series.[6] Despite disliking his initial job, Chandler stays because they keep giving him promotions and raises, eventually placing him as boss to his former coworkers. His friends do not understand what he does; during the contest for Monica and Rachel's apartment, Rachel desperately guesses "Transponster" for his job title (to which Monica replies in anguish, "THAT'S NOT EVEN A WORD!"). This results in Chandler and Joey winning their apartment.<pre>

            In the episode "The One Where Emma Cries", Chandler falls asleep during a meeting and on waking, realizes that he had agreed to head the new division in Tulsa. Chandler quits his job on Christmas so that he can fly home to New York to be with Monica. Monica helps Chandler secure a job in advertising through an old colleague of hers. Much to Chandler's dismay, he begins as an unpaid intern. However, his more mature approach eventually pays off, and he secures a full-time job in the business as a junior copywriter, which he enjoys much more than his previous career.
